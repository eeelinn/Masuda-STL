> Three-dimensional imaging and image processing of articular cartilage allows for direct assessment of cell organization in tissue volumes of various sizes and geometries (Figure 1). With confocal microscopy, successive thin z-sections are obtained by axial motion of the sample stage, allowing for capture of registered serial sections. However, even with laser-based multi-photon systems, imaging depth into the tissue is limited by diffusion and scattering of light, typically ≃100 μm in cartilage (Figure 1A) (Wong et al. 2001). A relatively new technique, digital volumetric imaging (DVI), overcomes this limitation via surface imaging microscopy, wherein volumes are obtained by physical sectioning and imaging the surface of fluorescently stained tissue embedded in an opaque polymer (Ewald et al. 2002). With this method, a large tissue volume, with depths effectively unlimited and practically up to several millimeters, can be imaged at high resolution (Figure 1B). With 3D data from such methods, 3D image-processing methods could be used to identify tissue features (e.g., cells) and quantify their organization. Automation and standardization of such methods would be useful to analyze samples quickly and repeatably.
